			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>

				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
				industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
				ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
				and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
				electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
				Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
				PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
